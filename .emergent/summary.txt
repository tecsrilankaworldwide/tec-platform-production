<analysis>
The AI engineer's work spanned two main phases: initial feature development for a learning platform and extensive Heroku deployment configuration and debugging. Initially, the AI identified the existing full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB Hello World application. It then proceeded to implement core learning platform features, including user authentication, course management, and dashboards, by modifying  and frontend React components. After basic API testing, the user revealed the intention to deploy on Heroku, presenting a screenshot of deployment failures related to Node.js engine specification and build issues. The AI subsequently focused entirely on resolving these Heroku-specific problems, making numerous adjustments to  (root and frontend), , , , and  to ensure proper Node.js and Python buildpack detection, correct engine versions, and a streamlined build process using yarn and craco. The process involved several iterations of fixing build scripts and environment configurations. The current state leaves the application configured for Heroku deployment, awaiting the user's attempt.

<product_requirements>
The user's initial implied requirement was to evolve a basic Hello World full-stack application into a fully functional learning/training platform. This led to the AI engineer implementing core features such as user authentication, course content management, student dashboards, instructor panels, and basic data analytics.

Mid-way, the explicit requirement shifted to resolving Heroku deployment issues for this developed platform. The user provided a Heroku template URL and a screenshot indicating problems like unspecified Node version, build failures, and app creation failure. The primary goal became to configure the existing application for successful deployment on Heroku, ensuring the frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) build and run correctly within the Heroku environment, adhering to specific buildpack and process configurations.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a comprehensive set of fixes and configurations aimed at enabling successful Heroku deployment of the TEC Learning Platform. This involved addressing issues reported via a user-provided screenshot, specifically concerning Node.js engine specification and build failures. The work focused on ensuring Heroku correctly detects and builds both the React frontend and FastAPI backend. Key actions included updating the root  and  to specify compatible Node and npm engine versions, creating a  to correctly run the FastAPI server, simplifying  for one-click deployment, creating a  file to define the correct build order (Node.js then Python), and updating  for Python version. The  script in the root  was configured to build the React frontend using yarn install v1.22.22
